**Siam Quantum (SQ)** is a compact open-source quantum simulation program, designed for research and education in mind. For research, its speed and accuracy are comparable to the well-established quantum chemistry programs. You could use it to do research and publish your results with confident that your results can be reproduced. For education, it is extensively documented in an easy-to-read math display using Jupyter Notebook which can also be viewed directly on GitHub.

## Executable

You can download the executable for MacOS, Linux, and Windows from the official website.
